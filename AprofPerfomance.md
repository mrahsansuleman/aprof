Benchmarks:
  * [DSP](DSP.md): an experimental evaluation of dynamic all pairs shortest path algorithms
  * [SPEC CPU 2006](SPEC2006.md): [CPU2006](http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/) is SPEC's next-generation, industry-standardized, CPU-intensive benchmark suite, stressing a system's processor, memory subsystem and compiler. SPEC designed CPU2006 to provide a comparative measure of compute-intensive performance across the widest practical range of hardware using workloads developed from real user applications.
