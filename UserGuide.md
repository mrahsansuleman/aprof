## Introduction ##

This project includes two main tools:

  * `aprof` is a [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) tool for performance profiling designed to help developers discover hidden asymptotic inefficiencies in the code. From a single run of a program, aprof measures how the performance of individual routines scales as a function of the input size, yielding clues to its growth rate and to the ["big-O"](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bigOnotation.html) of the program. **See the [aprof user manual](aprof_manual.md)**

  * `aprof-plot`  is a Java graphical user interface for visualizing reports generated by `aprof`. **See the [aprof-plot user manual](aprof_plot_manual.md)**

Please also take a look at our [tutorial](Tutorial1.md).
